    abstract = {{Rarefied gas flows obey to the Boltzmann equation, but numerical simulations of this equation are not always possible, so that simpler models have been introduced. The ES-BGK equation is one of these models. It gives the correct transport coefficients for the Navier Stokes approximation, so that Boltzmann or ES-BGK simulations are expected to give the same results for dense gases, but in the case of a rarefied flow, complete numerical comparisons are needed. In this paper we present numerical comparisons between the two models in transitional regimes (where the ES-BGK model is expected to be useful) for reentry flows around a compression ramp and a plate. We also emphasize that the ES-BGK model gives flow predictions closer to the Boltzmann result than the simpler BGK model.}},

    abstract = {{We present a new deterministic approach for the solution of the Boltzmann
kinetic equation based on nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations in
velocity space. In the new approach the collision operator has the form of a
bilinear operator with pre-computed kernel; its evaluation requires \$O(n^5)\$
operations at every point of the phase space where \$n\$ is the number of degrees
of freedom in one velocity dimension. The method is generalized to any
molecular potential. Results of numerical simulations are presented for the
problem of spatially homogeneous relaxation for the hard spheres potential.
Comparison with the method of Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) showed
excellent agreement.}},

    abstract = {{The Boltzmann kinetic equation is solved by a finite-difference method on a fixed coordinate-velocity grid. The projection method is applied that was developed previously by the author for evaluating the Boltzmann collision integral. The method ensures that the mass, momentum, and energy conservation laws are strictly satisfied and that the collision integral vanishes in thermodynamic equilibrium. The last property prevents the emergence of the numerical error when the collision integral of the principal part of the solution is evaluated outside Knudsen layers or shock waves, which considerably improves the accuracy and efficiency of the method. The differential part is approximated by a second-order accurate explicit conservative scheme. The resulting system of difference equations is solved by applying symmetric splitting into collision relaxation and free molecular flow. The steady-state solution is found by the relaxation method.}},
